The loss of energy (signal strength), proportional to the distance travelled, resistance met while travelling through the medium.
Only solution to this is using an amplifier, that increases the strength while also adding noise

To show loss or gain of energy, decibel is used

dB = 10log10(Po/Pin)
[[Amp usage]]

A loss in a cable is usually defined in decibels per kilometer (db/km). 
If the signal at beginning is -0.3db/km, power of 2mW
What is the power of the signal at 5km

db=10log(Po/Pi) = `0.3*5`
