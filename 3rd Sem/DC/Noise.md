Thermal: random noise of electrons in the wire creates an extra signal
Induced: In motors and appliances, devices act as transmitter slightly
Crosstalk: Same as above but between two wires
Impulse: Spikes that result from faulty power lines, lightning, etc

Signal To Noise Ratio (SNR) 
SNR = Average signal power / Average noise power
SNR(db) = 10Log10(SNR)
SNR = 10^(SNR(DB)/10)
