Power at home has frequency 60hz
-> time period = 1/60 = 16.6ms

A sine wave is offset by 1/6th of a cycle with respect to time 0. What is it's phase in deg and rad
Since 1 cycle is 360deg
Therefore 1/6 cycle is
`(1/6)*360 = 60 deg`
`60*2pi/360 = pi/3 rad `

Wavelength = propagation speed / Frequency
Bandwidth = Fh - Fl
