Computer network is a set of devices connected through links
Node can be computer, printer, or any device capable of sending or receiving data. Links connecting nodes are known as communication channels. 

Simplex: `Only one way connectivity`
Full-Duplex: `Dual connectivity with no interruptions`
Half-Duplex: `Dual connectivity but only one side can send at a time`

Point to point connection -> Two devices are connected by a dedicated link
Multipoint Connection -> multiple devices are connected to the same point

Types of network:
PAN Personal Area Network
Smallest network, bluetooth for a single person

LAN Local Area network:
meant for an entire building or school

MAN Metropolitan area network
Usually ethernet, fiber optics used. generally city-wide

WAN Wide Area Network:
Covers an entire country, usually telecommunication networks are WANS, this provide connectivity to MAN and LANs, since equipped with very high speed backbone, very expensive equipment

Distance covered = 1/(freq)

Logic Layers
	Application Layer
	Transport Layer
Network (IP address)
	Network Layer: [[Router]], Repeater, [[Gateway]]

[[Data Transmission]]

Transmission Impairments
[[Attenuation]]
[[Distortion]]
[[Noise]]

Max Bit Rate:
	Noiseless Channel: [[Nyquist Bit Rate]] -> Tells us about the number of signal levels required
	Noisy Channel: [[Shannon Theorem]] -> Tells us the upper limit
