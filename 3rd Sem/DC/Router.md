Router has a Routing Table
[[Router usage jpg]]

|Port Address| Destination Address|Next Hop|
|-|-|-|
|1|R4|R1|


Every router shares it's table with the other routers connected in that network
For every incoming port packet, there must be a destination address, for that the next hop is defined, etc
