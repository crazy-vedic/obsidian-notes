Bandwidth:


Throughput:
	Bandwidth of 10mbps, avg 12k frames/minute, 10k bits per frame
	therefore throughput
	``= (12,000*10,000)/60`

Latency
	Prop Speed = 
	Propagation delay = Distance / propagation speed
	Transmission Delay = Message size/Bandwidth
	Latency = Prop Delay + Transmission Delay + Queue time + Processing time
